NAME
    BSON - Pure Perl implementation of MongoDB's BSON serialization

VERSION
    Version 0.05

SYNOPSIS
        use BSON qw/encode decode/;

        my $document = {
            _id      => BSON::ObjectId->new,
            date     => BSON::Time->new,
            name     => 'James Bond',
            age      => 45,
            amount   => 24587.45,
            badass   => BSON::Bool->true,
            password => BSON::String->new('12345')
        };

        my $bson = encode( $document );
        my $doc2 = decode( $bson, %options );

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements BSON serialization and deserialization as
    described at <http://bsonspec.org>. BSON is the primary data
    representation for MongoDB.

LIMITATION
    MongoDB sets a limit for any BSON record to 16MB. This module does not
    enforce this limit and you can use it to "encode" and "decode"
    structures as large as you please.

EXPORT
    The module does not export anything. You have to request "encode" and/or
    "decode" manually.

        use BSON qw/encode decode/;

SUBROUTINES
  encode
    Takes a hashref and returns a BSON string.

        my $bson = encode({ bar => 'foo' });

  decode
    Takes a BSON string and returns a hashref.

        my $hash = decode( $bson, ixhash => 1 );

    The options after $bson are optional and they can be any of the
    following:

   options
    1   ixhash => 1|0

        If set to 1 "decode" will return a Tie::IxHash ordered hash.
        Otherwise, a regular unordered hash will be returned. Turning this
        option on entails a significant speed penalty as Tie::IxHash is
        slower than a regular Perl hash. The default value for this option
        is 0.

THREADS
    This module is thread safe.
